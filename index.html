    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise the client to use multiple ways to secure the website from attackers. this should be using https instead of http. Https uses encryption to ensure a secure communication between server and client.<br>
        Html sanitizing should be implemented on all the user data to ensure that it is more difficult to input malicious code in user forms. A web application firewall can also be used to sanitize all the data between user and the web page.<br>
        The website should encourage the users to use strong passwords and even better if they use two-factor authentication.<br>
        An automatic user time out is also good so that the user credential is not just stay in the browser when inactive. Its also important that if the user needs to store some sensitive data it doesnâ€™t show enough to get copied.<br> Like the last for digits of a credit card number or phone number<br>
        Frequent automated security scanning is important to keep the website up to date on new threats.
